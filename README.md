***This is your flight captain, Chidi Ononye, saying welcome aboard flight Norwich-code-102d5: Intro to Software Development***. What a lovely weather it is today! 
To make this a very remarkable learning experience, we have on board, **Rich, Chris, Sam and James.** 

Please fasten your seat belts as we navigate this 10 weeks journey. We might experience **a bit of turbulence** at different times, including this ascent. But not to worry, we will be at our **cruising altitude** in no distant time.  

Meanwhile, take out some time to explore some of our in-fligth entertainments. They have been organised to allow you follow us as we progress or you can jump right into any area that particularly interests you.

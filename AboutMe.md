# Welcome to my Page!

Getting to know me is like trying to figure out how deep the inner core of the Earth is. And yes, I mean that literally. At this time of my life, I have become so many thing through hard work and perseverance. I am a living proof that mastery in any create requires the right mind-sent and enough time committed to practice! Practice and more practice!

## Where do I start from?

I love to read and have read and read and still reading. I read across a wide range of field - technology, education, farming, entrepreneuship and personal development. I started reading at quite a young age and can remember going to the library in my community at 6 years and to the children's corner then to read. My love for reading has helped me keep up with the other areas I have had to work on and develop myself. 

## Educational and Professional Background:
I have a degree in **Electronic Engineering** and a **Master's in Educational Technology**. I have a **certificate in entreprenuership** and currently working on having extertise in **Porgrammong and Data Analytics**. A number of what I learn and become, I do some to help others learn and become same. **This is beauty of my training and role as a teacher.** I dymistified Math and Science for a good number of students back in Nigeria and I will love to do same again anywhere I find myself. 

*My love for learning equally led me to develop in the following areas:*

- Creative writing
- Speaking Skills
- Phonetics so I could help a good number of people read and spell. I was able to help children in their hundreds in Nigeria. 
 

In order of preference, my learning goals are:

1. For myself - I believe in the continuos and never ending improvement ***CANEI*** philosophy. When I make myself better, I am much more able to help others get better too. 
2. For others - My life has been a case of passing on as much as I am able to do to others. I love the excitement and that '*AHA!* feeling that goes with one knowing that a previously perceived challenged has been eliminated. 
3. To help as many people as I can make contact with also get better. I am highly optimistic and positive that learning to be a software developer will not be any different. 
4. To earn to live a comfortable life - Coincidentally, when we improve ourselves, our financial outcomes equally improves and we are better able to live the lives we have always desired. 

## My Hobbies

Interestingly, I also love to play. I started out with my kids but eventually expanded to hundreds of other children. I am actively involved in sports - ***tennis, football, volleyball, badminton and swimming.*** I also play a couple of our conventional board games like scrabble, monopoly, chess, cashflow for kids and whirredplay. I have been actively involved in sales and marketing, customers services and accounting roles. This skills have helped me hone and develop a great business mindset. I committed extra time and effort to develop these skills since I did not take them as formal courses my undergraduate or post-graduate studies. I became interested in farming in 2020 during Covid-19 pandemic. The lock-down led to my learning and cultivating tomatoes, bell and cayenne peppers, cabbage, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, watermelons and others. These were cultivated in easily available and cheap bags. I had to show others afterwards how to do same. The lock-down during the pandemic is at the bottom of my interest in technology - ***whether in educational technology or coding.***  

A great love of mine is also travelling. This is something I enjoy. However, I enjoy travelling best when it is with my family (wife and children).


Well, there it is for now. I hope you enjoyed reading about a bit of this incredible human - Chidi Ononye. 

Cheers and have a great week ahead!

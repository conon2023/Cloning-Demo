>“The illiterate of the twenty-first century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”- Alvin Toffler

Getting to know me is like trying to figure out how deep the inner core of the Earth is. And yes, I mean that literally. At this stage of my life, I have become so many thing through hard work and perseverance that I know well-enough that mastery and excellence can be achieved in any field or endeavor through the right mind-set and hardwork. With the right mind-set and ample time dedication for practice, *the sky will no longer be ***the*** limit but ***a*** starting point.* 

## Where do I start from?

I love to read and have read and read and still reading. I read across a wide range of fields - technology, education, farming, entrepreneuship and personal development. I started reading at a very young age and can remember vividly going to the library in my community to read. I was 5 years at the time. I love the children's corner and read quite a lot of very interesting classics at the time. My love for reading eventually spanned other genres as well. In retrospect, I now understand why it happened the way it did with the number of children and teenagers I have also helped to develop their love for reading in Nigeria.  

## Educational and Professional Background:
I have a degree in **Electronic Engineering**, a **Master's in Educational Technology** and a **Certificate in Entreprenuership** and currently working on developing expertise in **Programming and Data Analytics**. Well, I am sure you will agree with me when I say I am bunch of skills on the driver's seat. I simply love to add value wherever I find myself. As they say, one can only give what he or she has. 

I love teaching and eventually ending up teaching others whatever it is I know. I am able to help others understand complex concepts because I work to achieve an understanding of those concepts, myself, first of all. **This beauty of having trained as a teacher and educationist is that I can help all style of learners and learning.** I was able to dymistify *Math and Science* for quite a number of children and students back in Nigeria and I will love to do same as much as time and opportunity allows again. I am quite definite that my new role as a softward engineer and data analyst will also help empower people in their thousands to also contribute their own quota towards making our world a bettter place. I am sure it won't take long to find a place in HR or Operations as I continue to work on my skills as a software developer and data analyst. I am sure I will love to be part of the solutions when it comes to training issues with my rich and extensive background.  

*My love for learning!*

I love learning. I was able to get myself to a very high level of proficiency in the following areas through the same dint of hardword and the right mindset. These areas include:

- Creative writing
- Public presentation (Speaking) Skills
- Phonetics - this made it possible for me to help a good number of people read and spell - children and adults inclusive. 
 

In order of preference, my learning goals would be, first and foremost:

1. To myself - I believe in the continuos and never ending improvement ***CANEI*** philosophy. When I make myself better, I am much more able to help others get better too. 
2. To others - My life has been a case of passing on as much as I am able to do to others. I love the excitement and that '*AHA!* feeling that goes with one knowing that a previously perceived challenged has been eliminated. 
3. To Community - I have helped and would love to continue helping as many people as I can help through direct and remote contact. I am highly optimistic and positive that my learning software development at this time will also contribute massively to helping others develop this amazing skill as well.  
4. Financial Independence - I understand the correlation between excellence and income. I am very optimisitic that being an expert in a field like softward engineering will offer incredible financial rewards. I am one of those who work very hard but when I want to enjoy myself, I know how to go about it. Believe me, it is true. The kind of vacations I have in mind are of the exotic types.  

## My Hobbies

I love to play. I guess this has impacted my life's work greatly. Playing helps me connect with my students. I started out with my kids but eventually expanded to hundreds of other children. I am actively involved in sports - *tennis, football, volleyball, badminton and swimming.* I also play a couple of other  conventional board games like *scrabble, monopoly, chess, cashflow for kids and whirredplay.* I have been actively involved in *sales and marketing, customers services and accounting roles*. These skills have helped me develop and sustain a great business mindset. I became interested in *farming* in 2020 during Covid-19 pandemic. Because we were all indoors a great percentage of the time, I took up vegetable farming in my house. I planted and harvested *tomatoes, bell and cayenne peppers, cabbage, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, watermelons and others*. In addition, I equally got into photography, video editing and digital marketing. I was able to use those skills promote my children's club back in Nigeria. In all of these, I had to learn first and, eventually, was able to help others learn too. The lock-down during the pandemic remains at the bottom of my interest in technology - *whether in education, technology and/or business.   

A great love of mine is also travelling. This is something I enjoy. However, I enjoy travelling best when it is with my family (wife and children).


Well, there you a bit of me for now. I hope you enjoyed reading about a few of those areas that make an incredible person. We are all incredible anyway. The important thing is to find what resonates with each of us. 

Cheers and have a great week ahead!

Chidi Ononye.

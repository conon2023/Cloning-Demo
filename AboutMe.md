---# Welcome to my Page!

Getting to know me is like trying to figure out how deep the inner core of the Earth is. And yes, I mean that literally. At this time of my life, I have become so many thing through hard work and perseverance. I am a living proof that mastery in any create requires the right mind-sent and enough time committed to practice! Practice and more practice!

## Where do I start from?

I love to read and have read and read and still reading. I read across a wide range of field - technology, education, farming, entrepreneuship and personal development. I started reading at quite a young age and can remember going to the library in my community at 6 years and to the children's corner then to read. My love for reading has helped me keep up with the other areas I have had to work on and develop myself. 

## Educational and Professional Background:
I have a degree in **Electronic Engineering** and a **Master's in Educational Technology**. I have a **certificate in entreprenuership** and currently working on having extertise in **Porgrammong and Data Analytics**. A number of what I learn and become, I do some to help others learn and become same. **This is beauty of my training and role as a teacher.** I dymistified Math and Science for a good number of children. My love for learning equally led me to develop my creative writing and speaking skills. I thought myself phonetics so I can help as many as I could read, spell and speak. I eventually used the same skills to help thousands of children in Nigeria. 

The goal of any learning for me, first and foremost, is to make myself better. Next, is to help as many people as I can make contact with also get better. I am highly optimistic and positive that learning to be a software developer will not be any different. 

## My Hobbies

Interestingly, I also love to play. I started out with my kids but eventually expanded to hundreds of other children. I am actively involved in sports - ***tennis, football, volleyball, badminton and swimming.*** I also play a couple of our conventional board games like scrabble, monopoly, chess, cashflow for kids and whirredplay. I have been actively involved in sales and marketing, customers services and accounting roles. This skills have helped me hone and develop a great business mindset. I committed extra time and effort to develop these skills since I did not take them as formal courses my undergraduate or post-graduate studies. I became interested in farming in 2020 during Covid-19 pandemic. The lock-down led to my learning and cultivating tomatoes, bell and cayenne peppers, cabbage, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, watermelons and others. These were cultivated in easily available and cheap bags. I had to show others afterwards how to do same. The lock-down during the pandemic is at the bottom of my interest in technology - ***whether in educational technology or coding.***  

A great love of mine is also travelling. This is something I enjoy. However, I enjoy travelling best when it is with my family (wife and children).


Well, there it is for now. I hope you enjoyed reading about a bit of this incredible human - Chidi Ononye. 

Cheers and have a great week ahead!

# READ 01 - LEARNING MARKDOWN June 06, 2023.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used for formatting and structuring plain text. Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004. 

### Why do we use Markdown? 
1.	It is easy to learn and use. The syntax is designed to be straightforward and readable. 
2.	It is a human-readable and platform-independent language. Files can be easily shared and viewed across different devices and operating systems. 
3.	It markups to HTML conversion. Allows for writing content using a simplified syntax and then generating HTML. 
4.	It is versatile and widely supported. Markdown is supported by a vast range of applications, platforms, and content management systems (CMS).
5.	Consistency and readability: It provides a standardized way of structuring and organizing content, making it easier to read and understand. 
6.	Quick and efficient: It makes the writing process more efficient. 
7.	Version control compatibility: Works well with version control systems like Git. Changes can be easily tracked, viewed, and merged facilitating 

### What Symbol will Create a Heading in Markdown?
The #(hash) symbol will create a heading in Markdown. The number of hash symbols will determine the level of the heading. 
1.	We need one (1) hash (#) symbol to create the largest heading. 
2.	The smallest heading in Markdown will use six (6) hashtag (######) symbols that correspond to level 6. 
3.	When making texts bold or italicized, it is best practice to use the asterisks (*) symbol. 
4.	We create a link in markdown with the following syntax: [Click to visit page](url of page). The [] will contain the actual text the user sees. The () will contain the url of the page to visit. 

### In Markdown we can create an unordered (bulleted) list using the following symbols:
1.	Asterisk (‘*’)
2.	Hypen (‘-‘)
3.	Plus sign (‘+’)
The syntax is any of the symbols followed by space and then what you want to list.

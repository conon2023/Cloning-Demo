# READ 04 - STRUCTURE WEB PAGES WITH HTML June 07, 2023

**What is HTML?**
*HTML* (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating the structure and presentation of web pages. It defines the content and layout of web documents by using a set of markup tags and attributes. HTML is the backbone of web development and is interpreted by web browsers to render web pages.

**Why do we use HTML?**
*HTLM* helps us to structure and organize the content of a web page, such as text, images, videos, links, headings, and more. It provides a standardized way to represent information on the web, making it accessible, searchable, and easily understood by both humans and machines.

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
The three main parts of an HTML element are:

*The Opening tag:* This is the starting point of an HTML element and is represented by the tag name enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). It identifies the type of element as well as additional attributes that provide extra information about the element.

*Content:* This is the actual text, images, or other elements that appear within the HTML element. It is placed between the opening and closing tags of the element.

*Closing tag:* This is the ending point of an HTML element and is represented by the tag name preceded by a forward slash (</). It signifies the completion of the element. Not all elements require a closing tag, as some are self-closing or void elements (e.g., <img>).
For example, in the HTML element <h1>Hello, World!</h1>, the opening tag is <h1>, the content is "Hello, World!", and the closing tag is </h1>.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**
Giving an element extra information is called **adding attribute.** We use attributes to provide additional details and finctionality to HTML elements. They are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element. 

For example, in the HTML element <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">, the src and alt attributes provide extra information about the <img> element. The src attribute specifies the source URL of the image, and the alt attribute provides alternative text to be displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

**What is a Semantic element?**
A semantic element in HTML is an element that carries meaning or describes the structure and content of the web page to both the browser and the developer. It provides contextual information about the elements it surrounds. Semantic elements help improve the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall clarity of the HTML structure.

Some examples of semantic elements in HTML5 include <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, and more. These elements have a specific purpose and convey the meaning and structure of the content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to interpret and understand the web page.
